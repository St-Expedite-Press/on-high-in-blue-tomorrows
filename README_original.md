# The Burning World

This folder is an Obsidian-friendly working vault for a book/whitepaper project: **Canonical Digital Editions Under Conditions of Variance**.

**Start here (read like a document):** [[whitepaper/DRAFT]]

**If you want the raw thinking + technical contracts:** [[A_World_Burning/README]]

**If you want the core extraction/preprocessing contract first:** [[A_World_Burning/00_preprocessing_assay]]

## Directory Map (what everything is for)

- `whitepaper/` — the paper/book structure (front matter, sections I–XX, appendices A–J, compiled draft).
- `A_World_Burning/` — working corpus + technical contracts + provenance of how the system evolved.
- `abstract_photo_workflows/` — general-purpose “feature surface area” + workflow notes that feed the extraction/measurement sections.

## Melt Rule (non-destructive)

Nothing gets deleted. When a note is “melted” into the whitepaper:

- the whitepaper section becomes the **readable argument/spec**,
- the originating note remains as **provenance**,
- the section links back to the originating note(s) under “Sources (internal)”.

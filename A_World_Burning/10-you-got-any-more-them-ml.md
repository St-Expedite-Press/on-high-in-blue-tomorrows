# You Got Any More Them ML?

Short answer: **yes, but only in very specific, disciplined ways-and you don't have to use it at all if you decide not to.**  
Longer answer below, broken cleanly.

## The real question you’re asking

You’re not asking _“can we use AI?”_  
You’re asking:

> **Does this project require machine learning to be conceptually legitimate, or is ML just an accelerant / amplifier?**

The answer is: **ML is optional, but powerful if used surgically.**

---

## What machine learning would _not_ be doing here

You are **not** using ML to:

- invent content freely
    
- replace artistic judgment
    
- “style transfer” Audubon into climate art
    
- generate images from text prompts as the primary act
    

If you did that, the project would collapse into illustration.

## The three legitimate roles ML can play in _The Burning World_

Think of ML as a **measurement and mediation layer**, not an author.

---

### 1. **Perceptual measurement (non-creative ML)**

This is the safest and most defensible use.

ML models (CLIP, DINO, SAM) act as:

- _non-human perceptual instruments_
    
- ways of answering: _what does the image look like to a system that is not us?_
    

Examples:

- segmentation to separate organism from ground
    
- embeddings to measure visual similarity
    
- feature extraction to detect salience, repetition, anomaly
    

Here, ML is closer to a microscope than a brush.

You could truthfully say:

> “The machine is not creating anything. It is telling us where the image already breaks.”

---

### 2. **Constraint discovery (ML as boundary-setter)**

This is more interesting.

ML helps you discover:

- which transformations are plausible without destroying structure
    
- which regions carry most semantic weight
    
- where color or form can be pushed before coherence collapses
    

You then decide what to do.

In this role:

- ML **narrows the space of possible manipulations**
    
- You choose the actual path
    

This preserves authorship while avoiding arbitrariness.

---

### 3. **Conditional generation (late, optional, constrained)**

This is the most controversial—and should come last, if at all.

If used, ML generation would be:

- constrained by segmentation
    
- constrained by extracted color statistics
    
- constrained by structural priors derived from Audubon itself
    

Not “imagine a burning bird,” but:

> “Given this plate, under these altered chromatic and atmospheric conditions, fill only what the system has already marked as unstable.”

At that point, ML is simulating **failure modes**, not inventing imagery.

---

## The important counterfactual

You could do _The Burning World_ **without ML** by:

- rule-based color remapping
    
- physically motivated color transforms
    
- noise models
    
- sensor simulations
    
- hand-authored regimes
    

It would still be conceptually sound.

ML does not justify the project.  
The project justifies _selective_ use of ML.

---

## Why ML _might_ still be worth using

ML gives you two things you cannot fake easily:

1. **Non-human perception**
    
    - A way to escape purely aesthetic decisions
        
    - A sense that the plates are being “seen” under alien conditions
        
2. **Scale without repetition**
    
    - You can apply consistent but non-identical stress across 435 plates
        
    - Patterns emerge without being manually imposed
        

That aligns well with a climate catastrophe narrative:  
systemic, uneven, distributed.

---

## A clean rule you can adopt

> **ML may measure, segment, and mediate—but it may not decide meaning or final appearance.**

If a step violates that rule, it doesn’t belong in this project.

---

## Where this leaves you right now

At this point in the pipeline:

- ML is **not required**
    
- ML is **not yet appropriate**
    
- ML is **available later as instrumentation**
    

You are still in the phase of deciding:

- what kinds of failure you want to depict
    
- what counts as “burning”
    
- whether the catastrophe is thermal, atmospheric, perceptual, or archival
    

Once _those_ are defined, ML becomes a tool—not a temptation.

---

If you want, next we can:

- explicitly map which steps are **ML-free** vs **ML-assisted**, or
    
- design _The Burning World_ so it remains defensible even if you remove ML entirely, or
    
- decide what kind of “AI presence” you want the viewer to feel—if any at all.

_TOC-aligned entrypoint. Master outline lives in `A_World_Burning/26-whitepaper-skeleton.md`._


**Goal:** prevent automated authority and misuse.

- G.1 Non-claims (no intent inference; no definitive appearance claims)
- G.2 No restorative authority
- G.3 No biometric identity systems (general rule; face embeddings only for local alignment/blur/dedup if ever relevant)
- G.4 Weak-label policy (VLM outputs treated as weak signals; never truth)
- G.5 Institutional respect (credit, licensing, provenance)
- G.6 Security hygiene (secrets management; no `.env` leaks; threat model)

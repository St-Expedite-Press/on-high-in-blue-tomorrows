_TOC-aligned entrypoint. Master outline lives in `A_World_Burning/26-whitepaper-skeleton.md`._


**Goal:** show what remains unresolved, and why that matters.

- I.1 Dataset gaps (missing variants, institutional blind spots)
- I.2 Measurement brittleness (OCR, segmentation, embeddings)
- I.3 Governance questions (who sets constraints? how to revise them?)
- I.4 Evaluation questions (what benchmarks are legitimate?)
- I.5 Sustainability questions (storage cost, long-term verification)

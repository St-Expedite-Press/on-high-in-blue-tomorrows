_TOC-aligned entrypoint. Master outline lives in `A_World_Burning/26-whitepaper-skeleton.md`._


**Goal:** segmentation is documented as structure extraction, not meaning assignment.

- D.1 Model registry (SAM variants; Mask2Former; others)
- D.2 Input policies (resizing, tiling, cropping)
- D.3 Mask generation parameters and any filtering heuristics
- D.4 Mask representations and conversions (PNG â†” RLE â†” polygons)
- D.5 Rejection criteria (hard failures)
- D.6 QC metrics and dashboards
- D.7 What segmentation is explicitly not allowed to claim

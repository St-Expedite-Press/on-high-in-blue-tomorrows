# Rules

1. Always use the .venv (Virtual Environment).
2. Treat color regimes as separate runs (stored → linear → perceptual): see [[COLOR_REGIMES]].
3. No comments in code cells or scripts; use markdown/docs for narrative.
4. Do not commit datasets or derived run outputs to Git; keep them local/S3 and reference by manifest + checksum.

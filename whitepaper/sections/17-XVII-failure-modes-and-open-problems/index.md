## Draft (body text)

This project treats failure as first-class evidence: brittleness and uncertainty are recorded, not hidden. A canonical manifold that pretends to be stable is exactly the false authority the project rejects.

### XVII.1 Why documenting failure is part of the canon

When variance is preserved, the system will surface disagreements:

- between institutional digitizations,
- between embedding instruments,
- between segmentation regimes,
- between human expectations and model behavior.

These disagreements are not “bugs to be scrubbed”; they are part of the evidence about the digitization system and its limits.

### XVII.2 Typical technical failure modes

- image size extremes (tiling, memory limits, partial writes),
- OCR brittleness on inscriptions and ornate typography,
- segmentation confusion (paper vs background, border vs content),
- embedding instability across crops/resolutions and preprocessing pipelines,
- notebook-runtime realities (Drive performance, kernel death, silent restarts).

### XVII.3 Typical conceptual failure modes

- collecting differences without interpretive discipline (“variance fetishism”),
- naming motifs too early (premature ontology),
- importing institutional authority as editorial truth,
- conflating stress tests with historical truth.

Appendix I maintains an explicit ledger of open problems and unresolved risks.

  - XVII.1.b OCR brittleness on inscriptions
  - XVII.1.c segmentation failure cases (paper vs background confusion)
  - XVII.1.d embedding instability across crops/resolutions
  - XVII.1.e Drive/performance constraints; partial writes; kernel death
- XVII.2 Conceptual failure modes
  - XVII.2.a â€œvariance fetishismâ€ (collecting differences without interpretation discipline)
  - XVII.2.b premature ontology (naming motifs too early)
  - XVII.2.c institutional authority conflicts (who decides constraints?)

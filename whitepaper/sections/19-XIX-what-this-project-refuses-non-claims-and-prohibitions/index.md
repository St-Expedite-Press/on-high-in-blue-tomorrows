## Draft (body text)

Refusals are not rhetorical; they are structural. They prevent the canonical apparatus from being misread as authority and prevent downstream transformations from contaminating documentary evidence.

This section is intended to be citeable: a reviewer or collaborator should be able to point to a refusal as a constraint the system enforces.

### Core refusals

- No single “best image” output as canon (canon is the manifold + constraints).
- No claims about original intent or definitive appearance derived from model outputs.
- No restoration authority (“improvement” claims) in the documentary layer.
- No ecological forecasting presented as fact from stress images.
- No silent failure; no unregistered artifacts; no hidden state in runs.

Guardrails and non-claims are formalized in Appendix G.

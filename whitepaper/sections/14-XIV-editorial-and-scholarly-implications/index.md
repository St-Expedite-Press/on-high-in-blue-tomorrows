## Draft (body text)

If the canonical object is a manifold, scholarship changes at the level of citation, pedagogy, and institutional governance.

### XIV.1 Citation becomes a path, not a picture

In a manifold edition, citations identify:

- plate identity,
- the specific variant(s) referenced (including checksums),
- the measurement run(s) used (run IDs, model versions, config hashes).

This makes citation more technical, but also more honest: it prevents “the image” from being a floating reference.

### XIV.2 Teaching and publication (showing variance without losing legibility)

Instead of presenting one stable image, the edition can present controlled projections:

- a “typical” rendering (explicitly chosen, not implied),
- a variance viewer (multiple institutional digitizations side by side),
- a measurement view (segments/embeddings as overlays),
- an outlier view (what breaks similarity, and why).

Pedagogically, this turns variance from noise into evidence.

### XIV.3 Museums and libraries (governance of constraints)

Institutions often prefer to publish a single image for authority and branding. A manifold canon shifts the governance question:

- what constraints define admissible variants?
- how is provenance preserved across updates?
- how is drift detected and disclosed?

The institution governs the apparatus, not a “best image.”

### XIV.4 Conservation workflows (canonical does not mean pristine)

Conservation states and restoration interventions become first-class variants rather than silent updates. A canonical manifold can preserve:

- pre- and post-intervention digitizations,
- lighting regimes,
- disclosure of what changed and why.

This makes conservation histories legible rather than hidden.

## Outline (preserved)
**Purpose:** explain what changes for scholarship when the â€œworkâ€ is a manifold.

- XIV.1 Citation: from single images to variant paths
  - XIV.1.a citing plate_id + source_id + checksum
  - XIV.1.b citing run_id + config hash for derived measurements
- XIV.2 Teaching and publication: how to present variance without losing legibility
- XIV.3 Museums and libraries: governance of canonical constraints, not â€œbest imagesâ€
- XIV.4 Conservation workflows: â€œcanonical does not mean pristineâ€

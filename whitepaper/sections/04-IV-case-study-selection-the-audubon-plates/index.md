## Draft (body text)

The Audubon bird plates function here as a methodological stress case: a corpus where suppressing variance produces misleading certainty, and where acknowledging variance forces editorial discipline.

### IV.1 What the corpus is (bootstrap)

In bootstrap mode, the corpus is 435 plates (plate numbers 1–435) represented as one canonical source image per plate. Plate identity is stabilized using:

- plate number (`1..435`),
- stable internal ID (`plate-###`),
- title and slug crosswalks for deterministic acquisition.

The bootstrap corpus is treated as a scaffolding choice: it exists to make the canonical infrastructure buildable. It is not used to claim that the bootstrap rendering is authoritative.

### IV.2 Why Audubon amplifies variance

Audubon plates are unusually good at making “digitization difference” visible:

- **material complexity**: paper tone, border regions, foxing/staining, and fine engraved linework interact strongly with scanning pipelines;
- **mixed content**: images often include inscriptions, typography, and framing elements that are variably cropped or cleaned;
- **institutional divergence**: repeated digitizations across holdings produce measurable differences in color management, contrast, and damage visibility.

Even before multi-institution variance mode, the plates support rich internal measurement because they contain multiple “regimes” within a single image (organism, background, text, border).

### IV.3 Why Audubon is not treated as symbol

The choice is methodological rather than emblematic. The project refuses to treat “Audubon” as a moral symbol or an interpretive shortcut. The canon-under-variance problem generalizes to any image corpus with multiple digitizations, scan campaigns, or derivative reproductions.

Audubon is used because the corpus is tractable (435) and variance is common, not because the project claims Audubon is uniquely meaningful.

### IV.4 Boundary conditions (what counts as in-scope)

The corpus boundary is strict: 435 plates, stable internal IDs, and explicit inclusion/exclusion logs for any change. Variants may be added (multi-source mode), but the plate universe stays fixed unless the corpus version is explicitly bumped.

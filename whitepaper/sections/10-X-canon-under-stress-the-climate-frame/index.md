## Draft (body text)

The climate frame is a methodological stress test, not an evidentiary claim about the historical object. It exists to pressure the canonical apparatus: to ask what happens to similarity, clustering, and “best image” habits when stability cannot be assumed.

### X.1 Climate as frame, not illustration

The project refuses “climate as overlay” (aestheticizing catastrophe without discipline). Instead it defines climate stress as a set of constrained perturbation regimes applied downstream of documentation runs, with explicit parameters, bounds, and prohibitions.

### X.2 Archive instability is broader than climate

The title points beyond environmental crisis: archives are already unstable due to pigment drift, scanning artifacts, compression loss, institutional divergence, and undocumented restoration. Climate becomes one controlled pressure among many that reveal how canonical systems behave under instability.

### X.3 Stress as measurement

Stress transforms become admissible only when:

- defined as explicit axes (temperature shift, haze/ash occlusion, nocturne artifacts, contrast collapse);
- parameterized and logged;
- bounded by “do-not-cross” thresholds that prevent semantic hallucination.

All stress regimes and constraints live in [[A_World_Burning/37-appendix-f-climate-perturbation-regimes]].

### X.4 Forbidden operations

Stress transforms are explicitly prohibited from:

- inventing new anatomy,
- claiming restoration (“true color”),
- being treated as evidence about the historical object’s original appearance.

## Outline (preserved)
**Purpose:** define â€œstressâ€ as a controlled methodological pressure, not a claim about reality.

- X.1 Climate as frame vs climate as illustration
- X.2 â€œArchive instabilityâ€ as broader than climate (pigment drift, scanning, compression, institutional divergence)
- X.3 Stress testing as measurement
  - X.3.a perturbation axes (temperature shift, haze/ash occlusion, nocturne artifacts, contrast collapse)
  - X.3.b parameter discipline: axes, not knobs (link to Appendix F)
  - X.3.c safeguard constraints (do-not-cross thresholds)
- X.4 What is explicitly forbidden in stress transforms (no new anatomy, no restorative claims)

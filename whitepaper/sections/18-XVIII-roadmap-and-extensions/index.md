## Draft (body text)

The roadmap is governed by a single constraint: scale must not break epistemic discipline. More variants and more models increase power, but they also increase the risk of silent authority and contamination.

### XVIII.1 Scaling beyond Audubon

Scaling means:

- multi-institution ingestion (sources/variants as first-class objects),
- stronger drift detection and access control,
- more robust crosswalks between institutional identifiers.

Audubon is a tractable starting point; the method generalizes to any variant-rich visual corpus.

### XVIII.2 Interoperability targets

For institutional adoption, interoperability matters:

- IIIF exports for viewing and region-based access,
- standardized metadata crosswalks for catalog integration,
- export/import invariants that preserve IDs, checksums, and provenance.

### XVIII.3 Governance (who sets constraints?)

A manifold canon requires governance of constraints rather than selection of “best images.” Governance may include:

- curatorial boards for admissibility rules,
- parameter bounds for stress regimes,
- published policies for version bumps and exclusions.

### XVIII.4 Research extensions (instrument expansion)

Extensions remain admissible only if they preserve the separation doctrine:

- vectorization as a second representational regime,
- robustness curves as semantic fragility measures,
- additional “strange instruments” treated as probes, not truths.

### XVIII.5 Publication roadmap

The project can be published as:

- a foundational theory paper (canon as manifold),
- a methods paper (one corpus, honest failures),
- a systems architecture paper (the canonical stack).

## Outline (preserved)
**Purpose:** define how this scales beyond Audubon without breaking principles.

- XVIII.1 Scaling to multi-institution, multi-variant corpora
- XVIII.2 Interoperability targets (optional but recommended)
  - IIIF manifests / annotations
  - standardized metadata crosswalks
- XVIII.3 Governance models for canonical constraints (curatorial boards, parameter bounds)
- XVIII.4 Research extensions
  - vectorization as second representation regime
  - affect/atmosphere embedding axes
  - robustness curves as ?semantic fragility? measures
- XVIII.5 Publication roadmap (link to ?galaxy? in `A_World_Burning/25-reel-it-in.md`)
